# Geometric Parameter Extraction on 2D Seal Whiskers

## Overview 

- Purpose of project
- goal of project 

Whiskers are important sensor for seal deteacting vibrotactile information from the environment. Seal whiskers are demonstrated the diversity of shapes and most of them are exhibit a beaded morphology with repeating sequnces of crests and throughs along. Currently it is unclear the diversity of shape affects environmental signal modulation. In order to get some clues of it, this project implement geometric morphometrics method to demonstrate the 2D shape of whiskers.   


## Process 

- insert a process graph 
- explainations + graphs 

The photo of whiskers in two kinds of backgroud - green and black, as shown on figure 1 and figure 2. Rulurs are placed next to whisker for the purpose of referencing the size of whiskers.
