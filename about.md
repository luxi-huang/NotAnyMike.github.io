# Hello,

<img src="/img/me.png" alt="me" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: 200px;">

Hello,
I am Mike,

Currently, I am a M.Sc. student on Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh, what can I tell you about me?

Clearly, I am very interested in Machine Learning and Autonomous Cars. My thesis is in the area of Reinforcement Learning, more exactly Hierarchical RL. Going deeper into my Thesis topic, I can tell you in general that the idea is to develop a system to explore the benefits of HRL regarding Robustness, Explainability and Performance. Regarding the autonomous car part, the XAI system will be looking into actions related to car driving, such as turn left, stop, take over, etc. and given the number of smaller sub-models in the system, the environment is a simplified car env from open ai.

That was about my thesis, regarding some old facts about me, you should know I studied Mathematics, Engineering and Economics Majors in my undergrad. I loved exploring all those different paths but sadly I didn’t graduate from all of them. Thanks to the interdisciplinary work I ended up creating different groups and finally participating as a ‘researcher’ in some research groups at my old university. Those contacts took me to held interesting talks with industry leaders regarding self-driving technologies in the market and explore different possible and potential projects merging industry and academia.

One important part of me is my curiosity, you can see all my unrelated projects. Basically, I am curious and love learning and sometimes I get carried away. I have ‘built’ hacked Nintendos, learned how to play the piano, created some web pages, hacked some cars, learn several languages, etc. etc.

I don’t know what else to tell you, so, for now, I will let some links in which you can learn more about who I am:
